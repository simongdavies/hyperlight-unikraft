# hyperlight-unikraft

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/hyperlight-unikraft.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/hyperlight-unikraft)

Run ordinary Linux programs (e.g., Python, Node.js, .NET, Go, Rust, C, Bash) inside [Hyperlight](https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight) micro-VMs, using a [Unikraft](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) unikernel as the guest kernel.

hyperlight-unikraft ships as both a Rust library and a CLI. `hluk` (the CLI) boots the kernel, mounts a rootfs, runs your workload behind a **default-deny** host boundary (no filesystem or network unless you opt in), and can snapshot a warmed guest to skip startup on later runs. The same building blocks (`SandboxBuilder`, `run`, snapshot save/restore) are exposed as a library, so you can embed guest execution in your own application (`hluk` itself is a good reference consumer of it).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI (the Unikraft kernel is baked into the binary)
cargo install hyperlight-unikraft          # provides the `hluk` command

# 2. Clone the repo for the rootfs recipes and examples
git clone https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight-unikraft.git
cd hyperlight-unikraft

# 3. Build a guest rootfs (python-shell = Python + a BusyBox shell; needs Docker and `just`)
just build-rootfs python-shell

# 4. Run a Python hello world inside a micro-VM
hluk run --initrd build-elfloader/python-shell-rootfs.cpio --scratch-mb 256 examples/python/hello.py

# 5. Snapshot a warmed guest, then restore and run from it
hluk snapshot save --initrd build-elfloader/python-shell-rootfs.cpio --scratch-mb 256 --output .snapshots/python-shell
hluk snapshot run .snapshots/python-shell examples/python/hello.py
```

Run `hluk --help` for the full option set (`--mount`, `--net`, `--net-allow`, `--net-block`, `--port`, `--exec`, `--scratch-mb`, …). The `just` recipes (`just run <runtime> <script>`, `just snapshot-save`, `just bench`) wrap a locally built `./target/release/hluk`, which is handy when developing on the repo.

## Runtimes and platforms

hyperlight-unikraft runs on **Linux** (KVM, or MSHV with `cargo build --features mshv`), **Windows** (WHP), and **macOS** (HVF).

Guest runtimes include **Python**, **Node.js**, **.NET** (JIT and AOT), **Bash**, **Go**, **Rust**, **C**, and **PowerShell**. Two are Python variants with a BusyBox shell: **python-shell** (Python + a shell; a general base other images build on) and **agent** (python-shell plus preloaded data-science packages like numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, which are commonly used for agent code-executors). Any Python guest with `--net` can also `pip install` packages on demand from inside the guest (see [`examples/agent/pip_install.py`](examples/agent/pip_install.py)). See [support tiers](docs/guest-support-tiers.md) for the guarantee behind each; `just list-runtimes` prints the current set.

## Examples

Guest scripts under `examples/` run with `hluk run` (or `just run <runtime> <script>`):

- **HTTP servers** — `examples/http-server/{flask,express,kestrel}/` also show how to build a custom guest image on top of hluk's base runtime rootfs images (Python, Node, .NET AOT); see e.g., [`examples/http-server/flask/Dockerfile`](examples/http-server/flask/Dockerfile).
- **Concurrency** — `examples/python/threading_demo.py` and `examples/python/subprocess_demo.py` exercise guest threads and subprocesses.
- **Agents** — `examples/agent-framework/` runs a Microsoft Agent Framework agent with fully offline llama.cpp inference (`local.py`) or a remote model call (`remote.py`).
- **Workerd on Hyperlight** — [`docs/azure-workerd-hyperlight-runbook.md`](docs/azure-workerd-hyperlight-runbook.md) is a standalone Linux/KVM clone-and-run walkthrough with guided, individually runnable feature and performance demos.

Larger, self-contained demos live under `demos/`, each with its own `Justfile` and `README.md` (Linux):

- `demos/supply-chain/` — a typosquat supply-chain attack, contained by the VM.
- `demos/pptx-gen/` — LLM-written `python-pptx` code run in a sandbox to build a `.pptx`.
- `demos/urunc/` — deploy a guest through [urunc](https://github.com/urunc-dev/urunc) and containerd.

## How it works

1. **Load** — `hluk` embeds the Unikraft elfloader kernel and maps a rootfs CPIO (the guest userland) as the initrd.
2. **Boot** — Hyperlight starts a micro-VM and jumps to the kernel, which mounts the rootfs and runs your program through a small per-runtime driver.
3. **Sandbox** — by default the guest reaches nothing on the host. Capabilities are opt-in: `--mount` preopens a host directory, `--net` (with optional `--net-allow`/`--net-block` lists) enables networking, and `--port` lets the guest listen.
4. **Snapshot** — once a guest is warmed (interpreter initialised, imports loaded), its state can be saved and restored, so later invocations skip startup.

More details are in [`docs/`](docs/): how a guest is driven and the ways to run one ([`execution.md`](docs/execution.md)), the contract between a runtime driver and the kernel ([`driver.md`](docs/driver.md)), the host filesystem sandbox ([`fs.md`](docs/fs.md)), guest networking ([`net.md`](docs/net.md)), guest concurrency and snapshot restore ([`concurrency.md`](docs/concurrency.md)), the guest's clocks ([`clock.md`](docs/clock.md)) and its random source ([`random.md`](docs/random.md)).

## Development

```bash
just build-all-rootfs      # build every guest rootfs
just test                  # unit + integration tests (need the rootfs CPIOs)
just conformance python    # run a tier-1 runtime's upstream test suite
just ci                    # lint, license headers, tests, and demo smoke tests
```

## Benchmarks

Cold start, snapshot-restore latency, and throughput are measured on every merge to `main` for tier 1 runtimes, with trends [published to GitHub Pages](https://hyperlight-dev.github.io/hyperlight-unikraft).
