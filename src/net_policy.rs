//! Network access policy — controls which destinations a guest can reach.
//!
//! ## Policy variants
//!
//! - [`NetworkPolicy::AllowAll`] — all outbound connections permitted.
//! - [`NetworkPolicy::AllowList`] — only listed hosts/IPs permitted.
//! - [`NetworkPolicy::BlockList`] — all except listed hosts/IPs permitted.
//!
//! All variants refuse the cloud metadata addresses by default: the
//! link-local ranges (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10), where Azure, AWS and GCP
//! serve instance metadata at 169.254.169.254, and AWS's IPv6 endpoint
//! fd00:ec2::254, which is a unique local address rather than a
//! link-local one. Dedicated host-owned brokers may explicitly opt into
//! these address classes; the raw hostsock path cannot.
//!
//! [`AllowList`] and [`BlockList`] additionally block loopback (127.0.0.0/8,
//! ::1) because in the hostsock model a guest socket is a real host socket,
//! and host-local services trust loopback without authentication.
//! [`NetworkPolicy::AllowAll`] permits loopback to support intra-guest server+client
//! patterns (both endpoints are guest sockets on the host's loopback).
//!
//! ## Names and addresses
//!
//! A destination reaches the host as an address, never as a name: the
//! guest resolves names itself, with DNS questions that are ordinary UDP
//! messages to port 53, and then connects to what it was told.  The
//! policy is therefore enforced at three points:
//!
//! - **The question** (`allows_query`): the name is still a name here.
//!   Under an allow list the guest may only ask about listed names; under
//!   a block list it may not ask about a blocked one.  A guest that cannot
//!   ask never obtains the address.
//! - **The answer** (`learn_from_dns_answer`): under an allow list the
//!   addresses the guest was told for a listed name are recorded, so the
//!   connect that follows is recognised.
//! - **The destination** (`allows`): the address of every connect and
//!   sendto.  An allow list allows only what was listed, resolved when the
//!   list was built, or recorded from an answer; nothing is resolved on the
//!   host's behalf, so a guest connecting to an address it was never given
//!   is refused.  A block list refuses what was resolved when it was built
//!   and, since the guest may have an address without asking, whatever a
//!   blocked name resolves to now, looked up with a short deadline: a
//!   lookup that fails or runs late counts as blocked.
//!
//! The DNS exemption an allow list grants, port 53 at a known resolver,
//! covers UDP only, so a question cannot leave over a TCP connection the
//! question check does not read.  What no design covers: a block list
//! cannot refuse an address it was never shown to belong to the name.  An
//! embedder who needs a guarantee lists what is allowed.
